# Test Run Controls

A simple interface for controlling test runs of the ESS-DMSC software.

## Running the application

The application requires python 3.5+, and the packages listed in `requirements.txt` which can be installed with pip.
With that environment set up, the application can be run with:
```
python main.py
``` 
 
 ## Linter
 
 flake8 is used to check pep8 compliance. It is included in the requirements file, and can be checked by running
 `flake8` in the project's root directory.
 
 ## Flatbuffers compiled schemas
 
 The `run_info` and `det_spec_map` packages are generated by the flatbuffers compiler from their respective  `.fbs`
 schema files, which are included in the project root directory. If the schema's are updated, the generated code can be
 updated with:
 ```
 flatc --python -o <output directory> <fbs file>
 ```
 As per the [compiler documentation](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_using_schema_compiler.html)
 output directory should end with the systems path separator.
